### Project Name
Sandbox Sample Data Set

### Project Description
This project is a set of sample data that can be used to populate a clean NPSP install. Itâ€™s intended to be used for learning purposes, e.g. training new users or new admins of NPSP to get them familiar with the base platform.


### Project Audience
Admins who are developing and testing new business processes and need sample data for a sandbox.

### Project Team Accomplishments
The team created a scractch org and began populating it with sample data. Jason contributed mapping that can be used in conjunction with Cumulus CI to import this data into a CCI-created scratch org.


### Contributing
Continue to add to the sample data set to add more objects, more records, and more types of records. Consider adding in data that supports different business processes: for example, structure some data around different types of fundraising drives, volunteer programs, or engagement initiatives.


### Project Roadmap
The data set includes records of volume and diversity to make it a useful set of sample data for nonprofit organizations to load into a testing org and use as a "training ground".
